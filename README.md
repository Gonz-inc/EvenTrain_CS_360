# App Development Reflection

## User Needs and Requirements

This app aims to solve users' needs that require event tracking such as counting down when an event takes place, showing the time left for an event, creating user accounts, helping keep track of events, details with a database, and letting users receive text messages for upcoming events.

## Screens

The screens needed for this app to function properly are a login screen, setting screen for SMS enablement, control screen where a user will be able to add events, and a data display home screen where the user will see upcoming events.

## Techniques

The strategy I used to code the app was to incorporate the users' requirements while taking the graded rubric into account to meet the rubric. Ultimately, the new strategy I have learned is to break down the task by screen and refine the requirements and list all the concepts or methods needed for the entire project. This will set me up so that I can implement the right requirements to the current screen I'm working on. I plan on using this in the future by doing this project again but improving the requirements along with the features in the application. I will also use this for my web portfolio in the future.

Ideally, I would like to incorporate unit tests to see if the code performs as intended, but I have not used unit testing in Android Studio, so I will learn this in future implementations. The process I took so far was to test the screen as I develop the code to see if it works as intended and mark the code to see if there are any bugs when testing the screen. I would also try to use or access files such as the database file to see if the app actually added database information.

One process that I have to innovate to overcome a challenge was to utilize the time I had best by researching and implementing the requirements, note I took this in stages such as making the username and password work, then check if the buttons work, then see if the username and password were solved, if not mark it and move on to the next screen. The idea was to leave to-do notes on what needed to be fixed so that I could come back and correct stuff as needed. Although not optimal, I learned a lot from this and will implement the lessons I have learned from this process.

One component that I was successful in was using the navigation keys/buttons and creating a functional login screen, although I could improve on other components in the future these are stepping stones to what I have learned and the next stone will be to understand and manipulate databases.
